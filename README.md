# Jammmings - Create a Spotify Playlist.
> [!WARNING]
> No refresh token function added so the user should reset the website manually.

A web app that allows users to create a private music playlist from the Spotify Tracks Library ,using their API, save it and add it to their Spotify account. 

There is no CSS added so it doesn't look pretty :D. 

Used React to set up a website.

Basic Javascript used for interactions with the buttons and textfields.
